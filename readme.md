While matplotlib is a useful Python library, the plots generated using the default settings
can often be quite unappealing. Thus, I created this small repository which will create 
more beautiful matplotlib plots. 

Some of the code and ideas in this repo were taken from Randy Olsen's nice blog post 
(http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/28/how-to-make-beautiful-data-visualizations-in-python-with-matplotlib/).
